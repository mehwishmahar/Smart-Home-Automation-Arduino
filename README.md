# Smart-Home-Automation-Arduino

This project is a basic smart home automation and parking management system built using Arduino. It includes simple controls for home appliances and a parking system that uses sensors to detect vehicle presence. The aim is to make daily tasks easier, improve convenience, and demonstrate how automation can be used at home and in small parking areas.

## Features
- Smart home appliance control 
- Sensor-based parking detection  
- Simple and beginner-friendly design

## Components Used
- Arduino board  
- Ultrasonic/IR sensors
- Jumperwires and Breadboard
- LCD
- i2c module    
- LEDs

## How It Works
-The parking system uses sensors to detect when a car arrives and automatically opens the gate to allow entry.

-The smart door detects when a person approaches and opens automatically for easy access.

-Other home appliances are controlled similarly using sensors and relays to turn them ON or OFF automatically based on presence or commands.

The Arduino processes all sensor inputs and controls the devices to make the system smart and convenient.
